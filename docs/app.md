## Rekit app architecture
Like the official [Create React App](), you can also create an app by Rekit with one command line. The key difference of the two is CRA more likely creates an app for demo or prototype purpose, so the app is small and simple; but Rekit creates an app which is production ready, so it covers more aspects of a real world React, Redux application. Such as scalability, ease of development and testing, React router integrated, and variable optimizations.


### Divide a large app into small features
One of the key concepts of Rekit is dividing a large app into small pieces called features. A feature is some capability of an application. It's small and well decoupled, so it's easy to understand and maintain.

### Folder structure

### General optimizations
