Rekit is a toolkit for building scalable web applications with React, Redux and React-router.

It helps you focus on application logic instead of dealing with massive libraries, patterns, configurations etc.

A Rekit generated application is to be scalable, testable and maintainable by using feature-oriented folder structure, one action per file pattern. This ensures application elements are well decoupled.

With Rekit sublime text plugin, it's super easy to create features, components, actions, tests, etc by side bar menus. And you can test or build your applications without leaving the editor. Besides the plugin, all the features are also available as npm scripts, they could be used within a terminal.

Here is a quick look:

## Installation
```
npm install -g rekit
```
This will install a global command `rekit` to the system. Run the command to create a new project.

## Usage

### Changing Default Port

## Sublimetext Plugin

There is a simple forum application created with Rekit for reference: [http://github.com/supnate/rekit-example](http://github.com/supnate/rekit-example)

## Motivation
Creating web applications is hard today because there are too many technologies to learn. But it's also charming today, because there are so many great libraries helping to build complicated things in elegant ways. After enjoying creating a large application mainly with React, Redux and React-router, I decided to summarize it and make the approach re-usable, so I created Rekit.

This is an opinionate approach of building web applications, guranteed by tools. Almost all project elements could be generated by provided command line tools (also available as Rekit sublime plugin). So folder structure, namings, configurations could be always consistent so that they are easy to understand, analyze, maintain and test.

## Folder Structure
Rekit creates a web application with a special folder structure. It groups application logic by features. Each feature contains its own components, actions, routing config etc. Because of the fixed folder structure, we can easily generate code for common React + Redux tasks by writing tools. Rekit provides a powerful set of command line tools which help you writing code with consistent namings, places and tests.

```
|-- project-name
|    |-- src
|    |    |-- features
|    |    |    |-- home
|    |    |    |    +-- redux
|    |    |    |    |-- index.js
|    |    |    |    |-- DefaultPage.js
|    |    |    |    |-- DefaultPage.less
|    |    |    |    |-- route.js
|    |    |    |    |-- styles.less
|    |    |    |    |-- ...
|    |    |    +-- feature-1
|    |    |    +-- feature-2
|    |    |-- components

|    |    |-- build.js
|    |    |-- ...
|-- .eslintrc
|-- .gitignore
|-- .webpack.dev.config.js
|-- ...
```

## Action and Reducer in One File
This may be the most opinionate part of the Rekit approach, so I also introduce it here besides the docs site. That is: one action per file, and put the corresponding reducer into the same file.

This idea comes from the pain of regular Redux development: it almost always needs to write the reducer just after creating a new action.

Take a counter component for example, after creating a new action COUNTER_PLUS_ONE, we immediately need to handle it in the reducer, the official way is to write code in actions.js and reducers.js separately. By the new approach, we create a new file named `counterPlusOne.js` and put below code in it:
```javascript
import {
  COUNTER_PLUS_ONE,
} from './constants';

export function counterPlusOne() {
  return {
    type: COUNTER_PLUS_ONE,
  };
}

export function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case COUNTER_PLUS_ONE:
      return {
        ...state,
        count: state.count + 1,
      };

    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

In my experience, most reducers are bound to corresponding actions. The are rarely used globally. So putting them into one file is reasonable and it makes the development easier.

The reducer here is not a standard Redux reducer because it doesn't have an initial state. It's only used by the root reducer of the feature. And it is always named `reducer` so that the root reducer could auto load it from the action module.

This approach is one action one file, that is separting actions to files. For async actions, the action file may contain multiple actions because it needs to handle errors. For a Rekit application, each feature contains a folder named `redux` where we put actions, constants and reducers.

#### How about cross-topic actions?
Although not many, there are scenarios needing cross-topic actions. For example, when receving a new message:
  * If chatting box is open, display it.
  * If not, show a notification icon/message.
The `NEW_MESSAGE` action needs to be processed by different UI components. So there is a root reducer for each feature: `[feature-name]/redux/reducer.js` in which you write cross-topic reducers.

#### How root reducer of a feature works?
Although reducers for different actions are separated into different files, they operate the same state, that is the same branch of the Redux store. So a feature reducer has the below code pattern:
```javascript
import initialState from './initialState';
import { reducer as counterPlusOne } from './counterPlusOne';
import { reducer as counterMinusOne } from './counterMinusOne';
import { reducer as resetCounter } from './resetCounter';

const reducers = [
  counterPlusOne,
  counterMinusOne,
  resetCounter,
];

export default function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
  let newState;
  switch (action.type) {
    // Put global reducers here
    default:
      newState = state;
      break;
  }
  return reducers.reduce((s, r) => r(s, action), newState);
}

```
By using Rekit to create actions, you don't need to manually maintain this file because the Rekit will auto update it to add or remove the reducer import.

#### Benifits
This approach has multiple advantages:
  1. Easy to develop: no need to jump between files when creating acitons.
  2. Easy to maintain: action files are now small and easy to find by file name.
  3. Easy to test: one test file corresponds to one action which also includes both action and reducer test.
  4. Easy to write tools: no need to parse code when creating a tool to generate Redux related code. A file template is enough.
  5. Easy to analyze: cross-topic actions could be easily found by static analysis


## Philosophy
1. ***Different application logic for a single functionality should be placed in one place.***
You don't want to jump among different folders to edit code for the same functionality. Such as one functionality usually contains component, actions, reducers, styes, etc. Navigating between these files takes too much time when the project grows large and becomes complicated. So Rekit organizes different parts of a feature into one folder. You can finish a functionality just in one folder.

2. ***Developer should own every line of the project configuration.***
Configuration errors often cause weird behaviors of your application and they are usually very hard to debug. If you don't know how each part of your project works together, you are at the risk of wasting tons of time on configuration errors. So Rekit just creates the project with an initial correct config and put every line of configuration into your project, you should understand and is responsible to maintain it.

3. ***Developer should understand what a tool exactly does when using it.***
Tools could accelerate your development and reduce errors. But if you don't understand what it does behind, then you are at risk. So Rekit copies all tools with source code into your project instead of hiding it behind some commands. The source code is just there for your reference.

4. ***Developer should have his own tool set for the development.***
Rekit provides a basic tool set for a typical React + Redux project. Once the project is created, the tool set has no relationship with Rekit. So they could be easily customized so that it better fits the specific project needs.

## Key Features
 * Always pull the latest and verified package versions when creating a project. That is the new created project always has the latest dependencies.
 * All command line tools are copied to the project so that you fully own it, you can modify the tools to better match your project needs. Once the project is created, Rekit itself is no longer needed.
 * It's production-ready but not a starter kit.
 * Embed build script and test server for the build result.
 * Use [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) for bundling.
 * Use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for ES2015(ES6)+ support.
 * Use [React hot loader](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/) for hot module replacement.
 * Use [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) for application state management.
 * Use immutable state management.
 * Use [React-router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) for routing and it's configured with Redux reducer.
 * Not found page configured for React-router.
 * Use [Webpack dll plugin](http://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#dllplugin) to improve dev-time build performance.
 * Use [Less](http://lesscss.org/) as CSS transpiler.
 * Use [eslint-config-airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for code style check.
 * Support [Redux dev tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd).
 * [Webpack Dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard) integrated.
 * Command line tools to mange actions, reducers, components and pages.
